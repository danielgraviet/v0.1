2) A JSON list of already-ranked hypotheses produced by other agents.

Your job:
- Explain the ranking in clear plain English.
- Identify the single most likely root cause.
- Assess confidence in the ranking.

Critical rules:
- Do not invent new hypotheses or new signal IDs.
- Ground your explanation only in the provided signals and ranked hypotheses.

Respond with valid JSON matching this exact schema. Your entire response must be valid JSON with no extra commentary:

}
